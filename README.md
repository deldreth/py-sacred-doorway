#py-sacred-doorway 

Py-Sacred-Doorway aims to bring simple CV based control to "The Sacred Doorway" through the use of a KinectV1,
raspberry pi 2 B, and fadecandy NeoPixel controllers. 

Previous state of the project can be seen in the history section.

## History

Mid 2013 I built a small little frame box with several acrylic sheets in it. These sheets were dremmel etched
with various geometric shapes with an arduino duemilanove controlling the fade state of 7 LEDs placed on the edge 
of the sheets. The prototype project can be seen here:

Fast forward to early 2014 when I decided to make what would be the rather big final product: "The Sacred Doorway" 
(it's more of a window). Overall it stands 8 feet tall and is 4 feet wide. 7 8'x4' acrylic sheets are placed within
the frame with WS2812 NeoPixel strands lining the left and right edges of the acrylic. These were controlled with an
arduino mega. Final production can be seen here:
